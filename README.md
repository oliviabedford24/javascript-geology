# leaflet-challenge

Hello! This is the Module 15 Challenge for Rice University's Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp. Woohoo!

In this challenge, we used Javascript to make an API call from the US Geological Survey website. We used USGS's earthquake data to populate a Leaflet map with markers to show where earthquakes happened, their magnitude, and their depth.

The main code body for this challenge is contained in the "leaflet" folder in this repository. To view the map, open the index.html file in Google Chrome. 

The code contained in this file is my original work. I obtained advice and assistance from Rice University's team of instructors and tutors, but the work itself is mine and mine alone.

Psst. Why shouldn't you let a geologist drive your car?
....because they get hammered and stoned. 

*ba-dum tssss*
